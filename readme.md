### Basic C Server

## src directory
In source you will find a collection of example servers that I have worked on.
The idea behind the project is to develop skills behind threads and sockets. 

You will find the following
- __CE303__ containing a C++ port of an already existing repo done for a university assignment.
- __TCP/UDP__ containing code for either a tcp or udp server
- ... So far this is it

Main just houses testing code

Ideally by the end it would be able to create a file transfer server, useful for home use.
